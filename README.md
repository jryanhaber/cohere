# cohere

Building an app that will fulfill the following user stories in this order... 

1 

I can log in and track my degree of congruity with whatever the most fundamental, central orienting aim is that I choose for my life.  

Imagine what a mission statement is to an organization, but for an individual and more aimed at the quality of life over the particularities of it. 

2

When I check in on this, it tracks whether it has increased or decreased, and offers a chance to explain what impacted it. 

3 

It renders those things that increase my congruity and those which decrease them, helping me refine my activities such that they cohere
more fully every day with my stated aim. 

4 

Any user can edit the coherence variables for their purposes and do the same. 

5 

Additional coaching tools are implemented ( considering this ) for the check in process.
